## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), co-affiliate at the ECEO and NLP lab, advised by Prof. Devis Tuia and Prof. Antoine Bosselut. I am interested in multimodal learning and its application to geo-aware artificial intelligence. Previously, I obtained my master's degree in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence at Wuhan University IIP lab, working with Prof. Zhenzhong Chen.
