## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), co-affiliate at the [ECEO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/) and [NLP](https://nlp.epfl.ch/) lab, advised by [Prof. Devis Tuia](https://people.epfl.ch/devis.tuia) and [Prof. Antoine Bosselut](https://atcbosselut.github.io/). I am interested in multimodal learning and its application to geo-aware artificial intelligence. Previously, I obtained my master's degree in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Zhenzhong Chen](https://zhenzhong-chen.github.io/index.html).
